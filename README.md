# SnapCall Test

## Instructions

You will have to create a front-end application (and maybe a back-end one too) that will simply render data.

The front-end application will have to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) without using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You are free to chose all the other package you want to use (linters, compilers, etc).

## Levels

This test have multiple level, you can chose to only do one, two or the three of them.

Ideally, if you do the level 2, also do the level 1 and if you do level 3, do all of them.

1) [Render data from a JSON file](#level-1)
2) [Render data from a fetch call](#level-2)
3) [Create the API that returns the data](#level-3)

### Level 1

Your goal is to render data from the file `data.json`.

You can chose the way you render the data (table, list, etc).

### Level 2

Here you will have to render the current weather in **Paris** using the [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).

Same as level 1, you chose how you want to display things.

### Level 3

This level is similar to level 1, but instead of rendering data from the JSON file `data.json` directly, you will create an API that will serve this file and use it to render the data.

You are free to use any framework (or no framework at all) you want for the API.

## Bonus

No specific bonus but you can do anything you think would be an improvment to your application.

Some ideas would be:

- `dev` and `build` scripts
- Tests
