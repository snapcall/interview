# SnapCall Test

## Instructions

The project is intended to be done within 4 hours or less. You will push all your commits in a private GitHub repository that you previously created, and once you have finished your 4 hours, send an email to `thomas@snapcall.io` with an invitation to access the repo. Please note, we value more an unfinished project, that a finished project that overpassed the timeframe.

You will have to create a front-end application (and if you have time a back-end one too).

The front-end application will have to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) without using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You are free to chose all the other packages you want to use, e.g: linter, compiler, etc.

## Levels

This test have multiple levels, depending on your time, you can complete level 1, 2 and 3.

You can't not choose to do level 3 or 2, if you haven't completed level 1. The levels must be done successively.

1) [Render data from a JSON file](#level-1)
2) [Render data from an API request](#level-2)
3) [Create an API that returns the weather data](#level-3)
4) [Render the weather of any city](#level-4)
### Level 1

Your goal is to render the weekly weather from the file `data.json`.

Feel free to choose how to display the data

### Level 2

Here, you will have to render the current weather in **Paris** using the [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).

Same as level 1, you choose how you want to display the information.

### Level 3

For this level, you will create an API. Your goal is to get the weekly weather of any city. You could use [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) or any API that you may know to get the information :)

This implies, that a user will query your API searching for the weather of a given city.

You are free to use any framework, or no framework at all, to develop the API.

### Level 4

Now, that you have developed your own API, it's time to use it.

Modify your React application to use your new API, and render the weekly weather of any city. 

We recommend you to handle API responses correctly.

## Bonus

You can develop this technical test, applying any good practices, design pattern, environment configuration, or anything that would be an improvement to your application.

Some ideas would be:

- NPM scripts
- Unit tests
- Surprise us :)

Note: Remember you will not only be evaluated by the code, but also your decision making. üêø
